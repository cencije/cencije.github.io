# PersonalWebPage
Personal web page to display things for my CS major and work I have done.

This repository was created on the grounds that I wanted to display work I have completed for my CS degree and other projects I have been working on. This is an easy way to allow employers and others in communication with me to get a basic understanding of what I have to offer from a computer science perspective.
